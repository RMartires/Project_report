\begin_layout Abstract
Industrial pollution is one of the most serious problems faced today.
 Long term exposure to this pollution causes severe health issues including
 respiratory and lung disorders.
 Presently laws regarding industrial pollution monitoring and control are
 not stringent enough.
 But over the years, Government of India is in the midst of making these
 laws stricter.
 Hence, the proposed system aims at designing and building a gadget that
 are durable in highly polluted climates and resistant to a specified amount
 of temperature and pressure.
 The overall system consists of network of sensors that will be mounted
 in a specific industry, the data collected from these sensors will be stored
 on the cloud using Internet Of Things (IOT).
 These sensors measure the air parameters in terms of ambient air as well
 as stack emission.
 On this data we apply various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for prediction
 of emission rate.
 From the study of various ML algorithms, Kth Nearest Neighbours (KNN),
 Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Multi linear regression
 (MLR) and Neural network (NN) proved to have best results and hence were
 used.
 These algorithms were implemented using python and the mean square error
 of each of these was measured to check for accuracy and multi-linear perceptron
 model was seen to have the least error.
 The air dispersion models are then applied on the predicted emission rate
 to calculate the dispersion of pollutants from the source that is at stack
 level.
 Based on the study of various air dispersion models, the Gaussian model
 provides the most optimal solution in terms of relatively low computational
 time compared to others.
 The results were mapped onto a grayscale bit mapped image where the pixel
 colour represents the concentration.

\begin_layout Section
INTRODUCTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the rapid growth of the economy, industrial activities are increasing
 more frequently, leading to a faster rate of pollution.
 This rate is only increasing and if not kept in check can cause harmful
 effects to mankind and other living organisms.
 These effects are amplified if no regulation is kept in effect.
 Environmental pollution is one of the most serious problems facing humanity
 and other life forms on our planet today, industrial pollution contributing
 a major share in it.
 Industrial pollution is generally referred to as the undesirable outcome
 when factories or other industrial plants emit harmful by-products and
 waste into the environment such as emissions into two main mediums that
 are air and water.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Air pollution constitutes of solid particles and gases which includes dust,
 pollen and spores.
 Air pollutants can be largely classified into 2 categories that is, primary
 pollutants that are usually produced by processes that directly emit such
 as ash from volcanic eruption or vehicle exhausts, and secondary pollutants
 that are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants
 such as photochemical smog.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Water pollution include contamination due to domestic wastes, insecticides
 and herbicides, heavy metals and others, Such contamination can have a
 wide range of adverse effects such as waterborne diseases, overgrowth of
 toxic algae eaten by other aquatic animals and disruption of photosynthesis
 in aquatic plants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The six major types of air pollutants are Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen
 Oxides (
\begin_inset Formula $NO_{x}$
\end_inset

), Sulphur Oxides (
\begin_inset Formula $SO_{x}$
\end_inset

), particulates, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants.

Project Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Paris agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to
 the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this
 century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels

.
 Long term exposure to polluted air and water causes chronic health problems
 making the issue of industrial pollution a severe one.
 It also lowers the air quality in surrounding areas which causes many respirato
ry disorders affecting both lungs and heart.
 Not just humans, but the marine life is greatly deteriorating and affected
 with the extent of increasing industrial pollution.
 However, with effective measures, the ill effect of industrial pollution
 could be reduced significantly.
 The prevention and control of industrial pollution are highly encouraged
 by the government worldwide.
 Simple things like purchasing energy-efficient equipment and products made
 from recycled materials, and having industrial pollution control policies
 in place and strictly adhering to them.

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Draft Environment Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2015 was published by the Ministry
 of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) on October 7, 2015.
 The objectives of the Draft Bill are to provide for “effective deterrent
 penal provisions” i.e.
 a system that effectively punishes individuls, and to introduce “the concept
 of monetary penalty for violations and contraventions” i.e.
 a sum of money imposed for noncompliance.
 There are no effective strict rules for pollution monitoring and control
 in industries yet.
 But the government of India is making industrial pollution control and
 monitoring laws more strict.
 This action will create a demand for products and services that would aid
 in the process that the government underlines for companies to perform.

 the authors proposed a diagnostic model for calculating concentration distribut
ion of a passive scalar in a built-up area .This model basically requires
 measurements of the wind velocity and direction at a certain reference
 height above the obstacles.
 It is effectively able to predict 3-D concentration distributions and is
 also able to identify concentration accumulation at specific and precise
 points.
 It also succeeds in predicting concentration distribution both quantitatively
 and qualitatively.
 The model can be further used to study many air pollution phenomena.

 proposed a detailed approach to model dispersion which widely aims at combining
 the advantages of puff models and particle models.
 The resulting model type is called Puff-Particle Model (PPM).
 In PPM, hundred puffs in three dimensional space is collectively simulated,
 in comparison to many thousand particles usually required in pure particle
 models.
 The overall PPM concept is quite simple, while puff growth is described
 by the concept of relative dispersion which accounts for eddies smaller
 than the puff, causing effect of meandering.
 The variation between the trajectories of different puffs due to larger
 eddies, those larger than the actual puff size is simulated by introducing
 puff-center trajectories derived from particle trajectories from a particle
 model.

 the authors proposed that the Lagrangian Monte Carlo particle dispersion
 models works very effectively for the atmospheric dispersion of effluents.
 It was also mentioned that in order to incorporate the effect of vertical
 wind shear, the modified dispersion coefficient should be used with the
 existing Gaussian plume model.
 As an alternative, a much reliable 3D numerical model was used at a slightly
 greater computational cost.
 This numerical model can also be used in a complex topography region with
 hills and mountains, where mostly the conventional Gaussian models seem
 to be less effective and mainly not suitable.

 presented a model of (Nitrogen Oxide) NO emissions for a power plant boiler.
 It was modelled from the extended Zeldovich mechanism and it is observed
 that it requires only a few physical parameters obtained from experiments.
 A set of fresh new test data to compare the simulated values with real
 measurements was used.
 It was observed that model performed well with real plant input variables.
 The proposed model can also be used in other applications such as for optimizin
g boiler operation and combustion control system design.

 the authors proposed a model which provided an efficient polynomial network
 solution to the problem of tedious on-line monitoring of (Nitrogen Oxides)
 NOx emission from industrial boilers.
 The effect of six variables was considered and studied using 3D CFD simulation
 model and was used by polynomial networks for prediction of NOx and Oxygen
 (
\begin_inset Formula $O_{2}$
\end_inset

) in the exhaust flue.
 The prediction of NOx and 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{2}$
\end_inset

 are both essential for efficient operation and functioning of the boiler
 while maintaining the NOx pollutant within a tolerable limit.
 The proposed soft sensor has a simple modular structure for low cost implementa
tion which is greatly an advantage.
 This sensor can also be integrated with the boiler control system for optimizat
ion of boilers operation increasing the effectiveness.

 the authors presented a model, to study on the factors to affect the Particulat
e Matter (PM-10) pollution and developed a PM-10 prediction model using
 (Multi linear perceptron) MLP neural network model.
 A neural model was used especially because it has an advantage that there
 doesn’t exist a need to analyze the input data before the data are used,
 like that in regression model.
 Also, to improve and optimize the performance of the proposed model it
 required to shorten the learning period from year to quarter month and
 to learn and predict PM-10 with multiple networks according to the PM-10
 levels.

 proposed a good solution to the complexity of air pollution.
 It was observed that use of a large number of sensors ensures monitoring
 accuracy, greatly reduces monitoring cost and makes monitoring data in
 monitoring area more perfect and systematic.
 It was also noticed that addition of more meteorological factors would
 highly improve the prediction performance.
 It used past 5 years data for training the model, showing that large sample
 data can increase performance and train the model well.
 The overall experiment used IOT and neural network for air pollution monitoring
 and forecasting.

 the authors compared research work on air quality evaluation based on big
 data analytics, machine learning models and techniques and also highlighted
 some future resource issues, needs and challenges.
 It was stated that the accuracy of the air quality evaluation and assessment
 is affected by device faults, battery issues and sensor network.
 In this it was also mentioned that due to this issue there is a strong
 need for research in data quality modelling and automatic real-time validation.
 Also air in a city might be considered as a multi-level air system.
 The need for research and development of real-time air quality monitoring
 and evaluation and analysis on multiple levels was also highlighted.
 It was said that smart cities in the future must support real time air
 quality monitoring, evaluation and prediction.
 This gives rise to the need to develop integrated and dynamic air quality
 model using hybrid machine learning models.

 the authors conducted a comparative study of machine learning methods including
 nonlinear autoregressive exogenous inputs (NARX), artificial neural network
 (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) which been employed for air pollution
 prediction and the NARX was selected as the optimum one.
 The effective parameters for air pollution prediction have been determined
 in this research.
 This research used daily data of the pollutants.
 It also mentioned that the quality of the proposed model can be significantly
 improved if hourly data is implemented.
 Considering the importance of air pollution problem, it was recommended
 that the number of air pollution measuring stations increases so as to

 For this purpose a novel distributed fusion architecture to fuse heterogeneous

 developed a dynamic model to estimate source emissions and predict contaminant
 concentration in closed spaces.
 This was realized by using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm and least
 square method based on an established variable –structural contaminant
 model.
 The model could realize to track and real-time predict contaminant concentratio
n, and identify source emission rate accurately and efficiently.

 These sensors are usually placed in a large area for e.g.
 around a city or a large industry.
 The placement of sensors around a large area can reduce the accuracy of
 the model.
 This happens because of external factors like weather, noise, etc.
 affect the accuracy of the sensors to a large extent.
 Also, these models can’t accurately reflect the extent of pollution a particula
r industry is causing due to the large area.
 Some previous models also predicted pollutant concentration for the future
 based on machine learning algorithms.
 Also there were some models that predicted dispersion of pollutants from
 a point source i.e.
 the area to which the pollutants will spread to

.
 No previous models have linked the emission rate of the stack and the dispersio
n from the source(stack) together i.e.
 they have not been predicting the emission rate and calculating the spread
 in the same model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed model will however predict emission rate at the stack and use
 it as a source to calculate dispersion using air dispersion models.
 This will be done by placing sensors at the source (stack).
 Placing the sensors at the source will help the sensors take more accurate
 readings as the sensors will not be affected by external factors to a large
 extent as compared to the previous models.
 This will allow us to take more accurate readings and hence make more accurate
 predictions of future emission rates.

Objectives Of The Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objective of the project is to monitor the pollutants emitted from
 an industry/factory and predict the future dispersion of these pollutants
 also to then output these results in the form of reports for industries/factori
es.
 To accomplish this project, three objectives were identified that are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To create a series of gadgets which can measure the emission parameters
 and the meteorological parameters and also that can withstand the environmental
 conditions present near the stack/chimney and transmit this information
 to a server that is Internet Of Things (IOT).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To develop a module that uses Machine Learning (ML) models with data acquired
 from the cloud server to predict future emission parameter values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
DATASET AND STUDY AREA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the prediction module is to predict the emission rate at
 the stack/chimney.
 To build and test the prediction model, 1000 dummy data points were generated
 using Gaussian distribution to randomly generate values for the feature
 set with guidance from an industry expert, this data was later split into
 training and testing that is 80% and 20% respectively.
 The feature set is chosen on the basis of what factors will correlate to
 the emission rate and the type of pollutants emitted from the stack.
 The feature set consists of independent variables: day, month, type of
 industry, size of the industry, and output efficiency of industry and dependent
 variable: emission rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Type of industry: what the industry/factory produces which will correlate
 to what gases are emitted out of the stack/chimney, this will be in the
 form of labeled classes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Size of the industry: how big is the industry/factory which will correlate
 how much the maximum is outputted, this will be represented in the form
 of a scale from 1 to 10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Output efficiency: the amount of output it produces each day divided by
 the total amount of output it can ideally produce.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Emission rate: this is defined as the amount of pollutants released from
 the stack per unit time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prediction module is also used on the collected meteorological data
 to predict the air velocity and direction, this is then applied to calculate
 the dispersion of pollutants in the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feature set of this prediction model consists of independent variables:
 day, month, ambient temperature, ambient pressure, moisture content and
 dependent variables: the air velocity and air direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Day and month are used to timestamp data points also temperature, pressure
 and moisture content of the ambient air is correlated to the velocity and
 direction of air.

METHODOLOGY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 1 : methodology flow diagram, the overall setup consists of network
 of sensors that will be mounted in a specific industry at various places
 , the data collected from these sensors will be stored on the server.
 These sensors measure the air parameters in terms of ambient air as well
 as concentration.From the concentration of the pollutants the emission rate
 at the stack is calculated using inverse dispersion model .
 On this data, we apply various machine learning algorithms for prediction
 of emission rate for the future.
 The air dispersion models are then applied on the predicted emission rate
 to calculate the dispersion of pollutants from the source that is at the
 stack level.
 The entire system is basically divided into two broad categories: IOT and
 ML

Dummy data is generated using python.
 The dummy data was not truly random, it was correlated with various meteorologi

 It was observed that by adding more meteorological factors, the prediction
 performance is greatly improved and large sample data can improve performance
 and train the model well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementation of ML algorithms, machine learning algorithms were then implement
ed on the created dummy data to predict the value of 'Q' emission rate and
 'V' velocity of wind.
 For this purpose, the data was divided into training set (80%) and test
 set (20%).
 If the error reduces for training as well as test data, the process is
 continued.
 Else if the error reduces only for training data, but increases for test
 data then the process is terminated.
 This could greatly increase chances of generalizability of the algorithm.

Machine Learning Algorithms

\begin_layout Standard
Based on previous work the various machine learning algorithms were compared
 based on the pollutants considered, accuracy, simplicity, robustness, flexibili

 The following proved to have best results hence these were used:-

Kth Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-
\series default
 In this machine learning model similar things are considered to be in close
 proximity to each other.
 The value of K indicates the nearest neighbors that are taken for consideration.
 This similarity criterion can be based on distance or other similar factors.
 It uses a database that is separated into several classes to predict the
 classification of a new sample point.
 It is extended as a regression technique wherein the output of the point
 is the average or median value of its nearest neighbors.
 In KNN the training data required is very less, which means there is a
 lack of generalization [18].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Support Vector Regression (SVR)-
\series default
 SVR is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is being used for both
 classification and regression problems.
 In this algorithm, a data point is plotted in n-dimensional space after
 which it is classified by finding the plane that will differentiate the
 classes very well.
 The hyperplane which is considered is a linear separator of any dimension
 (line, plane, hyperplane).
 The training points are used in decision function and are called support
 vectors [19].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Random Forest (RFS)-
\series default
 The decision tree is a decision support tool.
 It uses a graph in the form of a tree to show possible consequences.
 Random forest operates by constructing multiple decision trees during the
 training phase.
 The decision of the majority of the trees is chosen by the random forest
 as the final decision.
 When a training data set is considered with targets and features, some
 set of rules are formulated, these rules are used to perform predictions.
 It identifies the most important features out of all the available features
 in the training dataset.
 The larger the no.
 of trees the more accurate the results will be.
 Random forest classifier handles missing values and overfitting problem
 doesn’t exist [20].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Multilinear Regression (MLR)-
\series default
 This technique uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome
 of the response variable.
 A linear relationship is modeled between these independent and response
 variable (dependent).
 Prediction about one variable is done based on the information about the
 other variable.
 In this case, the independent variables should not be too highly correlated
 with each other [21].

Neural Network (MLP)-

 it is a model that mimics the way the human brain operates.
 A neuron in a neural network is a mathematical function that collects and
 classifies information according to some specific architecture.
 A neural network contains layers of interconnected nodes.
 Each connection is associated with a weight that is multiplied with the
 input value.
 Each neuron has an activation function that defines the output of the neuron
 which is used to introduce non-linearity in the network model [22].

 is a steady-state system, the concentration of pollution downwind from
 a source is treated as spreading outward from the stack.
 A point source was considered somewhere in the air where a pollutant is
 released at a constant rate Q (kg/s).
 The wind is blowing continuously in a direction x (measured in meters from
 the source) with a speed U (m/s).
 The plume spreads as it moves in the x-direction such that the local concentrat
ions C(x,y,z) (kg/m3) at any point in space form distributions which have
 shapes that are Gaussian or normal in planes normal to the x-direction
 i.e.
 the concentration of the pollution will be maximum at the source and will
 gradually disperse where this dispersion follows a gaussian curve.
 The maximum concentration is in the direction of the wind and there will
 be lateral dispersion on the y-z plane.
 The more the dispersion area, the more diluted will be the pollutant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lagrangian Model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lagrangian model determines the trajectory of air pollutants.
 The pollutants are tracked as air parcels which move along trajectories
 determined by wind field, the buoyancy and turbulence effects.
 The trajectory calculations are based on ordinary differential equations(ODE)
 instead of partial differential equations which are used in the gaussian
 dispersion model.
 The estimation of the concentration field is given by the final distribution
 of a large number of particles.
 The particles can be tracked from the source area to the area of reception.
 The computational cost of these models is independent of the output grid
 resolution and hence they are very efficient for short-range modeling.
 For long-range simulations, however, the computational cost increases as
 there is a need to calculate a large number of single trajectories.
 Also, a large amount of computational power is required to handle a large
 number of puffs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Puff-Plume Model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The puff-plume model maintains the advantages of the puff models and also
 of the plume models.
 The pollutant particles are grouped in clusters.
 These clusters are treated as Gaussian puffs which are dispersed using
 the concept of relative diffusion.
 The center of mass of each puff follows a stochastic trajectory.
 The particle trajectories of the Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model
 gives the trajectory of the puffs.
\end_layout

RESULTS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prediction module and air dispersion module was implemented in python
 programing language using Spyder Integrated development environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prediction module was tested on the dummy data set generated then the
 precision was measured by finding the deviation of the predicted value
 from the actual value using mean square error.
 In an attempt to optimize the models the parameters of the models were
 tuned and the response (mean squared error) was graphed out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The air dispersion module was implemented to calculate the concentration
 from a stationary steady state point source i.e.
 stack and the results were plotted onto a grayscale bitmap image where
 the pixel color represents the concentration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Machine Learning Module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different Machine Learning algorithms were studied and implemented on the
 same dataset and the results were compared.
 Table 1: shows the range of error in the respective models while the parameters
 were tuned

The results of the prediction module clearly shows that the multi-perceptron
 regression model has the least mean square error out of all the models
 also we can see that the error using test data loosely follows the error
 using training data i.e.
 the area between both plots over parameter tuning does not change much
 which is a good indication that overfitting is not occurring.
 Whereas multi-linear regression has the most error due to its simplistic
 design.

 implemented using python programing language.
 The results were then represented using a thresholding functions to map
 different concentration levels with a color level, and this was saved as
 an image file.
